# Snowman Attack

Snowmen are attacking your "secret."

DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO STOP THEM?!

Do you have the mental fortitude to chuck rocks, litter your yard with campfires, rock salt, and industrial strength fans, and maybe even set off some nukes to stop their approach?

What is this "secret"?

All this and more are yours to discover in SNOWMAN ATTACK!
